# Acrobat Pro Killer

## Acknowledgements

This code was *lovingly* crafted with the help of **ChatGPT**. Yes, an AI helped make this. So if something doesn’t work, feel free to blame the robots. But if it *does* work? Yeah, that was totally on purpose.

**Acrobat Pro Killer** is the *ultimate* PDF viewer and editor you never knew you needed—because who doesn't want to *destroy* Adobe Acrobat Pro with a Python script? Built with **PyMuPDF** for handling PDFs and **PyQt5** for a *questionably modern* GUI, this tool is designed to be a *sleek* (or at least *functional*) alternative to the bloated giants of the PDF world.

## Features

- **Fast(ish) PDF Rendering:** It opens PDFs... eventually.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** If you’ve used a computer before, you might figure it out.
- **Zoom and Navigation Controls:** Because what’s a PDF viewer without basic functionality?
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Well, *lightweight* doesn’t always mean *fast*, and *efficient* is open to interpretation.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository (for the full experience) or the lastest release
Because downloading from GitHub is half the battle:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SQA2009/acrobatprokiller.git
cd acrobatprokiller
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SQA2009/acrobatprokiller/releases
```

### 2. Install Required Packages  
You’ll need a couple of Python packages to get this masterpiece running:

```bash
pip install PyMuPDF PyQt5
```

## Usage

### 1. Run the Application  
Let the magic unfold by running:

```bash
python acrobatprokiller.py
```

### 2. Open a PDF File  
- A file dialog will *probably* appear. Select your PDF and hope for the best.

### 3. Navigation & Features  
- **Zoom In/Out:** There's a slider. Use it. It's not rocket science.
- **Scroll:** Your mouse wheel is your best friend.
- **Page Jump (WIP):** You thought you could jump to pages? Not yet, but hey, dreams are free.

1. **Open Terminal (or Command Prompt):**

   - Click **File > Open**.
   - Choose your PDF with fingers crossed.
